# Notes for Claude

## Logging (owner's rule, always)
- Every feature or fix writes to console.txt — when unsure, and also when sure,
  because a later edit might break it. The log is how bugs get found in the
  real game.
- GardenToPlate: use `HARMONIE_GTP.Log(tag, fmt, ...)` (prints
  `[HARMONIE_GTP][tag][SP|client|server] ...`). For anything that repeats
  every tick or every frame, use `HARMONIE_GTP.LogOnce(key, tag, fmt, ...)`
  or log only on state changes. Never flood the log every frame or tick.
- Other mods: same idea with their own prefix (e.g. `[HARMONIE_HM]`).
- Log: load or setup results (counts), every network message that is
  rejected or dropped, fallbacks taken (a missing API, a pcall failure),
  user actions in our windows, and first-time / daily summaries.
